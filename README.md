Using your camera, you can give me a right hook, left hook, and uppercut.

I used the [gest.js](https://github.com/hdmchl/gest.js) library to access the user's camera and determine if the gesture made is to the left, right, or down.

I made a series of frames and then I created an animation algorithm to cycle through the appropriate frames.

Only problem is that gest.js does not work well if the lighting is not optimal. The best lighting I've found is if you have lights behind the camera and no lights behind you.
